# Aviation Accident Analysis Project

##  Project Overview

This project explores aviation accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
It involves cleaning raw data, analyzing factors that contribute to accidents, and visualizing the results through dashboards and charts.

The main goals of this project are:

* Understand accident distribution across manufacturers
* Analyze causes of accidents over time
* Identify the most affected aircraft types and purposes
* Provide recommendations for improved aviation safety
